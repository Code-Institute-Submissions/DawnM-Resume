        <p>I have completed various graphic design, web design, and web development courses online over the past 2 years.  I would like to join a company that offers exposure to a range of projects where I can use and develop my new skills. A company with a focus on people or the environment would be ideal, but is by no means essential.</p>
        <p>My favourite aspects of previous roles were always on the creative side, whether improving existing forms and documentation for ease of use, or working on branding projects. My new skills will allow me to make these preferences the focus of my career.</p>
        <p>What I currently lack in development or design experience, I make up for with over 18 years of varied industry experience.  This enables me to more easily relate to clients’ processes and needs, which can then be translated into solutions.</p></div>
